# Welcome to ForceCalendar! 📅

Hi there! If you want to build a calendar for your website or for Salesforce, you've come to the right place. 

Think of **ForceCalendar** like a big box of LEGOs. We give you all the pieces you need to build a beautiful calendar that works exactly how you want it to.

<div class="eli5-card">
  <h3>🧒 What is it, really?</h3>
  <p>Imagine you have a <strong>Robot Brain</strong> that knows everything about time, dates, and meetings. Then, you have a <strong>Pretty Suit</strong> that the brain wears so people can see the dates and click on them. That's ForceCalendar!</p>
</div>

## The Three Main Parts

To make things easy, we split ForceCalendar into three simple parts:

### 1. The Brain (`@forcecalendar/core`)
This is the smartest part. It doesn't have a "face" (you can't see it), but it knows:
- How to handle different time zones (so you aren't late for your zoom call in London!).
- How to handle "Every Wednesday" meetings without you having to type them in every time.
- How to find events really, really fast.

### 2. The Face (`@forcecalendar/interface`)
This is the part people actually see and touch. 
- It has buttons to go to the "Next Month."
- It has pretty colors.
- It works on any website, like magic!

### 3. The Salesforce Suit (`salesforce/`)
If you use Salesforce, we have a special version that fits perfectly inside it. It's like putting a custom-tailored suit on our calendar so it can live happily in the Salesforce world.

## Why should I use it?

- **It's super fast**: Even if you have 10,000 events, it won't lag.
- **It's helpful**: It warns you if you try to book two things at the same time.
- **It's friendly**: It works with React, Vue, Salesforce, or just plain old HTML.
