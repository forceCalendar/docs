```js

## Constructor

```ts
new LRUCache(maxSize: number)
```

## Methods

| Method | Signature | Returns |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `get` | `(key: string) => any \| undefined` | Value (moves to most-recent) |
| `put` | `(key: string, value: any) => void` | — |
| `has` | `(key: string) => boolean` | — |
| `delete` | `(key: string) => boolean` | — |
| `clear` | `() => void` | — |
| `keys` | `() => Iterator<string>` | Key iterator |
| `getStats` | `() => CacheStats` | Statistics |

## CacheStats

```ts
interface CacheStats {
  size: number;
  maxSize: number;
  hits: number;
  misses: number;
  evictions: number;
  hitRate: number;
}
```

## Implementation

Uses JavaScript `Map` insertion order semantics for O(1) operations:

- `get()`: Delete and re-insert to move to end (most recent)
- `put()`: Insert at end; if over capacity, delete first entry (least recent)
- All operations are O(1) amortized
